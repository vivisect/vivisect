Developer Guide
===============

The guide is written by vivisect developers for anyone who wants to make use of the API that vivisect supplies or dive into the internals of how vivisect works

.. note::
    While we do try to keep the API relatively stable, these documents may not always be 100% accurate and we update vivisect. If you spot anything that needs updating or fixing, please let us know in the vivisect room in the Synapse slack or log an issue in the Github issue tracker.
