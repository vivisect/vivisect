'''
Late-PLT analysis.

During codeflow analysis, we detect PLT entries organically (and consequently
*accurately*), but often not all of them.  This analysis module applies a few
different algorithms to identify the ones which were not discovered during
autoanalysis.

Formerly, we attempted to do this analysis before all other code analysis
but due to so many varieties of PLT creation by different compilers on
numerous hardware platforms and OSes, that method lead to many errors in PLT-
identification, often hampering vital parts of vulnerability-research tools.
We finally pulled the plug on preemptive analysis, in favor of letting auto-
analysis identify "truth" and then filling in the gaps.

    We make use of two different algorithms for each.
    The first algorithm measures the distance from the start of known good PLT
    functions and the GOT-referencing branch.  The only weakness is that this
    method requires that the xref to the GOT is already identified (without
    throwing and emulator in there).

    The second algorithm measures the distance between known good PLT entries
    and then attempts to identify divisors (up to 16 splits) which would make
    more than one PLT function fit between them.  These attempted splits are
    validated using heuristics of the potential functions which would be created
    by the division.  PLT entries in the same PLT section are incredibly similar
